This website is an annotated list on recent open source software and frameworks for programmable and virtualized 5G cellular networks, with a full stack and end-to-end perspective. The different sections of the website list software projects and frameworks that can be used to build a software-based 5G networks, including the Radio Access Network (RAN), the Core Network, O-RAN, virtualization and orchestration frameworks, and open hardware and testbeds on which such software can run.

This website itself is open source and hosted on [Github](https://github.com/open-5g/open-5g.github.io), so that anyone can contribute relevant information and keep it up to date. It is maintained by researchers at the Institute for the Wireless Internet of Things at Northeastern University, who have co-authored the paper at the base of this project:
